When we opened Dirty Rabbit, people kept asking: "What kind of café are you?" And honestly, we didn't have an easy answer.

We're not a cycling café — though some come after their rides. We're not just for tourists — though we love it when they come back year after year. We're a bit of everything, really. And that's exactly what we wanted.

## Wild Comfort

There are mornings of total rush — kids running around, orders flying, the machine non-stop. And there are afternoons where the same space becomes a quiet refuge. A book, a flat white, nothing else.

We like that contrast. The espresso that wakes you up at 8am and the quiet cortado at 2pm. Energy when you need it, calm when you're looking for it.

## Belonging

María comes every Tuesday. Same corner table. Same cortado. We don't even ask anymore.

That's what happens when a space is genuinely welcoming. Strangers become regulars. Regulars become friends. Not because we "built a community" — but because this is what naturally happens when you feel welcome.

The family with the noisy kid. The digital nomad with the laptop. The older couple who've been coming since week one. Everyone fits.

## Intentional

The coffee is from La Cabra in Copenhagen. Not because it sounds impressive — but because it's what we drink at home. The bread comes from Origo Bakery because we tried twenty bakeries and this one made us stop looking.

There's nothing on the menu that Iwonka wouldn't serve in her own kitchen. That's the rule.
