Dirty Rabbit didn't start as a coffee shop. It started as an idea: what if there was a place in S'Agaró where you could feel at home?

## Home

Here you're not a customer, you're a guest. Your table is waiting. Your coffee is made just how you like it. We want you to walk in as a stranger and leave as a friend.

## Care

Every product we serve is chosen with intention. Our coffee comes from La Cabra in Copenhagen — one of Europe's best roasters. Our bread is baked by Origo Bakery in Barcelona. Our pastries arrive from La Puntual in Girona. Nothing is here by accident.

## Connection

The best thing about a café isn't the coffee. It's the conversations that start at the bar. The kids playing while parents enjoy a quiet breakfast. The foreigners who become locals. We want to be the place where people find each other.
