If you've found yourself searching for good coffee on the Costa Brava, you probably already know it's not easy. Most places serve the same industrial coffee — the kind that needs sugar to be drinkable.

But something is changing.

## What is specialty coffee?

It's not marketing. It's coffee scored above 80 points by professional tasters. Coffee with complete traceability: you know which farm it came from, who grew it, and how it was processed.

The result is coffee that tastes like *something*. Notes of fruit, chocolate, flowers, caramel — things you wouldn't expect from a cup of coffee. And the best part: it doesn't need sugar.

## Why it's hard to find

The Costa Brava lives on tourism. And mass tourism doesn't demand quality — it demands volume and low prices. That's why most cafés serve generic coffee: it's cheaper and it "works."

But for those of us who live here year-round, or for visitors looking for something better, that reality is frustrating.

## What we do differently at Dirty Rabbit

We work with **La Cabra**, Danish roasters who have spent over a decade defining specialty coffee in Europe.

Why Denmark? Because the Nordic countries were the first to take coffee seriously. While the rest of Europe kept burning beans, they perfected light roasting — the kind that lets coffee taste like what it is.

Our current espresso is an **Ethiopia** with notes of tropical fruit and flowers. The batch brew changes seasonally — right now we're serving a **Honduras** with chocolate and nut notes.

## Tips for recognizing good coffee

1. **Ask where it comes from** — If they can't tell you the origin, not a good start
2. **Look at the color** — Dark roast hides defects. Light-medium roast reveals them
3. **Try it without sugar** — If it needs sugar to be drinkable, it's not good coffee
4. **Check the machine** — A quality espresso machine (La Marzocco, Synesso, Slayer) usually means they take coffee seriously

## Other options in the area

We're not the only ones doing things right. Some recommendations:

- **Lo-fi Coffee** (Platja d'Aro) — Another serious option for specialty coffee
- **ANNNA** (Sant Feliu de Guíxols) — Good breakfasts with decent coffee

The scene is growing, little by little.

## Come try it

We're in S'Agaró, a 5-minute walk from Sant Pol beach. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 8:00 to 15:00.

Your first coffee with us is going to surprise you. And if you don't like it — the next one's on us.
