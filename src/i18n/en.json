    "questions": {
      "reservation": "Can I make a reservation?",
      "reservationAnswer": "We don't take reservations — we believe in spontaneous brunch. But don't worry, turnover is quick and we always find a spot. Weekends before 10am are usually quieter.",
      "wifi": "Is there wifi?",
      "wifiAnswer": "Yes, free and fast. Perfect for getting some work done — but your laptop comes with a coffee, right? 😉",
      "dogs": "Are dogs allowed?",
      "dogsAnswer": "Absolutely! Dogs are welcome both inside and on the terrace. We always have fresh water for them.",
      "parking": "Is there parking nearby?",
      "parkingAnswer": "Yes, free parking right next to the venue. There's also blue zone parking nearby if it's full.",
      "events": "Do you host private events?",
      "eventsAnswer": "Yes, for small groups outside regular hours. Email us at hola@dirtyrabbit.es with your idea and let's see how we can make magic.",
      "dietary": "Do you have vegan/gluten-free options?",
      "dietaryAnswer": "Yes. Vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, plant-based milks available. For gluten-free, ask — we have several options but the kitchen isn't 100% gluten-free.",
      "specialty": "What is specialty coffee and why do you use it?",
      "specialtyAnswer": "It's genuinely good coffee — grown with care, roasted in small batches, and tastes like more than just 'coffee'. Notes of fruit, chocolate, flowers... things you wouldn't expect. We work with La Cabra from Copenhagen because they roast light and respect the bean. The result? Coffee that doesn't need sugar to taste good. Try it and let us know.",
      "coffeeOrigin": "Where does your coffee come from?",
      "coffeeOriginAnswer": "Our espresso is from La Cabra (Copenhagen) with Ethiopian beans. Batch brew changes seasonally — currently Honduras. Decaf is from Puchero. Every origin is chosen for flavor profile, not price.",
      "decaf": "Do you have decaf coffee?",
      "decafAnswer": "Yes, from Puchero. And the best part: it's free. We don't charge extra for decaf because everyone deserves good coffee, with or without caffeine.",
      "kids": "Is it suitable for children?",
      "kidsAnswer": "100%. We have a high chair, changing table, and a terrace where kids can move around. The Rabbit Power smoothie is their favorite. Families are part of our community.",
      "terrace": "Do you have a terrace?",
      "terraceAnswer": "Yes, cozy outdoor terrace with shade. It faces the street, no views — but it's quiet and perfect for breakfast. In summer it's the favorite spot.",
      "location": "How do I get there from Sant Pol Beach?",
      "locationAnswer": "We're a 5-minute walk from Sant Pol, heading up Avinguda de Platja d'Aro. After a swim, an ice cream or iced latte hits the spot.",
      "camiRonda": "Are you close to the Camí de Ronda?",
      "camiRondaAnswer": "3 minutes from the coastal path. Many hikers stop here before or after their route. The large batch brew is perfect for recharging.",
      "groups": "Do you have space for groups?",
      "groupsAnswer": "For groups up to 8, yes. Larger groups are difficult without booking. For private events outside hours, email us.",
      "takeaway": "Do you do takeaway?",
      "takeawayAnswer": "Yes, everything. Coffee, smoothies, toasts... We use sustainable packaging. Perfect for taking to the beach.",
      "payment": "Do you accept card?",
      "paymentAnswer": "Yes, card, cash, and mobile payment. Whatever works for you."
