      "reservation": "Can I make a reservation?",
      "reservationAnswer": "We don't take reservations — we believe in spontaneous brunch. But don't worry, turnover is quick and we always find a spot. Weekends before 10am are usually quieter.",
      "wifi": "Is there wifi?",
      "wifiAnswer": "Yes, free and fast. Perfect for getting some work done. But if you're staying all day, we ask you to order something every couple of hours — we're a small café and need the tables.",
      "dogs": "Are dogs allowed?",
      "dogsAnswer": "Absolutely! We have a terrace where your furry friend is welcome. Inside we can't due to health regulations, but we always have fresh water outside.",
      "parking": "Is there parking nearby?",
      "parkingAnswer": "Yes, free parking right next to the venue. There's also blue zone parking nearby if it's full.",
      "events": "Do you host private events?",
      "eventsAnswer": "Yes, for small groups outside regular hours. Email us at hola@dirtyrabbit.es with your idea and let's see how we can make magic.",
      "dietary": "Do you have vegan/gluten-free options?",
      "dietaryAnswer": "Yes. Vegetarian and vegan options on the menu, plant-based milks available. For gluten-free, ask — we have several options but the kitchen isn't 100% gluten-free."
