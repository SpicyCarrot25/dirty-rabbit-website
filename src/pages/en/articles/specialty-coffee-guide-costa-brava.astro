        <p class="mb-4"><em>The Costa Brava has been synonymous with beaches, hidden coves and beach bars for decades. But in recent years, something has changed: a new generation of cafés is transforming the area into a destination for those of us who love good coffee. This is the most comprehensive guide to specialty coffee on the Costa Brava — written by locals, updated in 2026.</em></p>

<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">The Specialty Coffee Map of the Costa Brava</h2>
<p class="mb-4">The specialty coffee scene on the Costa Brava is young but growing fast. From Cadaqués in the north to Lloret de Mar in the south, there are more and more places to have coffee that goes beyond the usual cortado.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We&#39;ve divided it by area so you can plan your coffee route:</p>
<ul class="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
<li><strong>S&#39;Agaró — Platja d&#39;Aro — Sant Feliu</strong> → The epicentre, with 5+ options in 10 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Palamós — Calonge</strong> → Expanding zone</li>
<li><strong>Begur — Pals</strong> → Beautiful village + real coffee</li>
<li><strong>Girona city</strong> → The province&#39;s coffee capital</li>
<li><strong>Cadaqués — L&#39;Escala</strong> → For those heading north</li>
</ul>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Zone 1: S&#39;Agaró — Platja d&#39;Aro — Sant Feliu de Guíxols</h2>
<p class="mb-4">This is the area with the highest density of specialty coffee on the entire Costa Brava. Within a 10-minute drive, you have five real options.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">🐇 Dirty Rabbit — S&#39;Agaró</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Avenida Platja d&#39;Aro 275, S&#39;Agaró</strong> · <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=13237319999262880412">Google Maps</a></p>
<p class="mb-4">If you ask us (and yes, it&#39;s us, so the bias is obvious), Dirty Rabbit is the best speciality coffee on the Costa Brava. But we&#39;ll explain why with facts, not marketing.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We serve <strong>La Cabra</strong>, the Danish roaster that&#39;s been among the best in the world for years. It&#39;s not just &quot;good&quot; coffee — it&#39;s single-origin coffee, traceable to the producer, processed with precision and roasted in Copenhagen. We prepare it on a <strong>La Marzocco KB90</strong> with <strong>reverse osmosis</strong> filtered water — every variable controlled.</p>
<p class="mb-4">But Dirty Rabbit isn&#39;t just about coffee. It&#39;s a place to have eggs benedict after a swim at Sant Pol, work on your laptop on the terrace, or stay for two hours chatting. We call it &quot;your home away from home&quot; because that&#39;s what we want it to be.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Breakfast and brunch:</strong> Toast with Benfumat smoked salmon, La Puntual pastries (Girona), Origo Bakery sourdough bread (Barcelona). REQ organic matcha. Awachai chai.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Languages:</strong> Spanish, Catalan, English and Polish. Menus in Russian, French and Ukrainian.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> The coffee (La Cabra), the space (bright, cosy), the location (3 min walk from Sant Pol Beach).</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ La Maglia Coffee &amp; Co — Platja d&#39;Aro</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>C/ Juli Garreta, 10, Platja d&#39;Aro</strong> · 5 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">La Maglia has the honour of being the first specialty coffee roaster on the Costa Brava coast. They roast their own speciality coffee. The name comes from the Giro d&#39;Italia pink jersey — it&#39;s a very cyclist café, so on Saturday mornings you&#39;ll see gravel groups drinking flat whites.</p>
<p class="mb-4">They offer açaí bowls, toast with La Farinera sourdough (Sant Feliu) and juices. The large terrace works well for a quick coffee. They&#39;re expanding to a 300m² space in Calonge for 2027.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Their own roast — if you&#39;re interested in local coffee, it&#39;s a solid option.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ ANNNA — Sant Feliu de Guíxols</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Carrer de l&#39;Hospital 21, Sant Feliu de Guíxols</strong> · 7 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Ana and Pascal set up ANNNA in Casa Trachsler, a 19th-century manor house in Sant Feliu&#39;s old town. They work with <strong>Three Marks Coffee</strong> from Barcelona. It&#39;s speciality coffee, gluten-free artisan bakery and concept store — all in one. Their gluten-free sourdough is one of the best we&#39;ve tried, and the selection of local products (oils, wines, ceramics) is worth a visit just to browse.</p>
<p class="mb-4">Open Thursday to Monday, 9:00–14:30. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Toast with their artisan bread + a flat white. The space itself is beautiful.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Maison Marcel — Sant Feliu de Guíxols</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Sant Feliu de Guíxols</strong> · 5 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">A cosy spot in Sant Feliu with quality coffee. It&#39;s not confirmed they work with a recognised specialty roaster, but the level is noticeably higher than the area average. Good brunch and pleasant atmosphere.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Quick option if you&#39;re in Sant Feliu and want something above standard coffee.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Grace Coffee — Platja d&#39;Aro</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Platja d&#39;Aro</strong> · 5 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Quality-focused café with good reviews (4.6 on Google with 275 reviews). If you&#39;re in central Platja d&#39;Aro and don&#39;t want to move, it&#39;s an option for decent coffee.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Central location in Platja d&#39;Aro.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Zone 2: Palamós — Calonge</h2>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Dupla — Sant Antoni de Calonge</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Sant Antoni de Calonge</strong> · 8 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Speciality coffee working with <strong>La Finca Coffee</strong> from Barcelona. Near the seafront promenade.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Zero — Palamós</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Palamós</strong> · 12 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Palamós is famous for its red prawns, but also has coffee options. Zero offers speciality coffee from <strong>Originem</strong> (Girona) in a modern atmosphere.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Zone 3: Begur — Pals</h2>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Fitzroy Café — Begur</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Begur</strong> · 20 min drive · 🏖️ <em>High season</em></p>
<p class="mb-4">Fitzroy is an institution. Inspired by Melbourne coffee culture, they work with <strong>Hola Coffee</strong> from Barcelona. They offer cult brunch (their banana bread is legendary), cocktails in the evening and a terrace that&#39;s pure Begur. It&#39;s seasonal — open mainly in high season.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Brunch + the terrace in a beautiful village. Worth the trip.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Grava — Pals</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Pals</strong> · 20 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Café + pizzeria + natural wines. They work with <strong>Right Side Coffee</strong> from Barcelona. Very popular with gravel cyclists. If you come by bike through the Pals rice fields, it&#39;s the perfect stop.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> The combo of coffee + pizza + wines in a spectacular setting.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Zone 4: Girona — The Coffee Capital</h2>
<p class="mb-4">Girona city is where the specialty coffee concentration is highest. In a 15-minute walk through the centre you can visit 5+ international-level cafés.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ La Fábrica — Girona</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Girona</strong> · 35 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">Founded by cyclist Christian Meier, La Fábrica roasts their own coffee under the Approachable Coffee brand. It&#39;s probably the best-known speciality coffee in Girona — cycling, specialty and a beautiful industrial space.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Their own roast and the connection with cycling culture.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Espresso Mafia — Girona</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Girona</strong> · 35 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">From the same group as La Fábrica (Approachable Coffee). More central, smaller, faster. Good espresso to go.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Hors Catégorie — Girona</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Girona</strong> · 35 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">They work with Nomad Coffee from Barcelona. Another café with cycling DNA. Good level and considered atmosphere.</p>

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Girona</strong> · 35 min drive</p>

<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Originem — Girona</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Girona</strong> · 35 min drive</p>

<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">☕ Casa Nereta (Café Nereta) — Cadaqués</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Cadaqués</strong> · 60 min drive</p>
<p class="mb-4">The big surprise: Casa Nereta serves <strong>La Cabra</strong> — the same Danish roaster we use at Dirty Rabbit. Since 2025, Cadaqués has world-class coffee. The trip is worth it if you&#39;re in the north of the Costa Brava.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> La Cabra in Cadaqués. Unthinkable a few years ago.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">

<p class="mb-4"><strong>Cadaqués</strong> · 60 min drive · 🏖️ <em>High season</em></p>

<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Is speciality coffee worth it?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Yes. The difference between a standard bar espresso and one from specialty coffee is like the difference between box wine and a crianza. The bean, the roast, the preparation — everything changes. Try it once and you&#39;ll understand.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What makes coffee &quot;specialty&quot;?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Coffee scored above 80 (usually 85+) on the SCA scale. Traceable to the farm of origin. Roasted with care to highlight the bean&#39;s natural notes, not to hide them. Prepared by baristas who know what they&#39;re doing.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">Is it much more expensive?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">A coffee at Dirty Rabbit costs between €2.50 and €4.50. At a standard bar you&#39;d pay €1.50–2.50. The difference is €1–2 for a completely different experience. We think it&#39;s worth it.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">What&#39;s the best time for a coffee route on the Costa Brava?</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Spring (April–June) or autumn (September–October). All places are open, no crowds and the weather is perfect. In winter some close (Fitzroy, Re Mei). In summer there are lots of people but all options are available.</p>
