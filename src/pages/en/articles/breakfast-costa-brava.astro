        <p class="mb-4"><em>The Costa Brava isn&#39;t just beaches and hidden coves. In recent years, the breakfast gastronomy scene has evolved spectacularly. From the traditional &quot;cafè amb llet i croissant&quot; to Australian-style brunches with avocado toast, the variety is enormous. This guide covers the best breakfast options across the Costa Brava, organised by area.</em></p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">What You Should Know Before Choosing Where to Have Breakfast</h2>
<p class="mb-4">The Costa Brava has almost 200 kilometres of coastline, from Blanes to Portbou. The breakfast offering varies enormously depending on the area:</p>
<ul class="space-y-2 mb-6 list-disc pl-6">
<li><strong>Tourist areas</strong> (Lloret, Platja d&#39;Aro): many options, but quality is uneven</li>
<li><strong>Charming villages</strong> (Begur, Cadaqués, Pals): fewer places, but usually better</li>
<li><strong>Residential areas</strong> (S&#39;Agaró): limited options but authentic</li>
<li><strong>Girona city</strong>: the highest density of quality coffee shops</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Important schedules:</strong> Many places close between seasons (November-March). In summer, the best ones fill up quickly — especially at weekends between 10:00 and 12:00.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h2 class="font-typewriter text-2xl md:text-3xl mb-4 mt-12">Zone 1: S&#39;Agaró — Platja d&#39;Aro — Sant Feliu de Guíxols</h2>
<p class="mb-4">This is the area with the most quality options within a short radius. In 10 minutes by car you can choose from five or six good spots.</p>
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">🐇 Dirty Rabbit — S&#39;Agaró</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Avenida Platja d&#39;Aro 275, S&#39;Agaró</strong> · <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?cid=13237319999262880412">Google Maps</a></p>
<p class="mb-4">Dirty Rabbit is our café (yes, we&#39;re writing this guide, so the bias is obvious). But we&#39;ll tell you why we think it&#39;s worthwhile, with facts.</p>
<p class="mb-4">We serve coffee from <strong>La Cabra</strong>, the Danish roaster that&#39;s been among the best in the world for years. We prepare it on a <strong>La Marzocco KB90</strong> with <strong>reverse osmosis</strong> filtered water. If coffee is your thing, you&#39;ll notice from the first sip.</p>
<p class="mb-4">But Dirty Rabbit is more than coffee. Breakfast includes toast with <strong>Benfumat smoked salmon</strong> (the best smoked salmon in Catalonia), pastries from <strong>La Puntual</strong> (Girona bakery), and sourdough bread from <strong>Origo Bakery</strong> (Barcelona). We also serve <strong>REQ</strong> matcha and <strong>Awachai</strong> chai — we&#39;re not limited to coffee.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Location:</strong> 3 minutes&#39; walk from Sant Pol Beach. Perfect for breakfast before or after a swim.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Languages:</strong> Spanish, Catalan, English, Polish. Menus in Russian, French and Ukrainian.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Relaxed breakfasts, brunch with friends, remote work with WiFi.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">La Maglia Coffee &amp; Co — Platja d&#39;Aro</h3>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Carrer Juli Garreta, 10, Platja d&#39;Aro</strong> · 5 min drive from S&#39;Agaró</p>
<p class="mb-4">La Maglia has the honour of being the first speciality coffee roaster on the Costa Brava coast. They roast their own speciality coffee with 100% arabica beans. The name comes from the Giro d&#39;Italia pink jersey — on Saturday mornings you&#39;ll see groups of cyclists drinking flat whites.</p>
<p class="mb-4">They serve açaí bowls, sourdough toast from La Farinera (Sant Feliu) and natural juices. The terrace is large and works well for a quick breakfast or staying a while.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Best for:</strong> Cyclists, local coffee lovers, healthy breakfasts.</p>
<hr class="my-8 border-black/20">
<h3 class="font-typewriter text-xl mt-8 mb-4">ANNNA — Sant Feliu de Guíxols</h3>

<p class="mb-4">Their gluten-free sourdough is one of the best we&#39;ve tried in Catalonia. The selection of local products (oils, wines, ceramics) is worth a visit just to browse. The space itself is beautiful.</p>
<p class="mb-4"><strong>Hours:</strong> Thursday to Monday, 9:00–15:00. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

<p class="mb-4">The coffee isn&#39;t from a speciality roaster, but you come here for the bakes, and they&#39;re exceptional.</p>
